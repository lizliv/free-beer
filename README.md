# free-beer
 Testing out a website for the free beer guild


Starting inspiration is this build randomizer: https://github.com/Ferndor/AlbionBuildRNG


# Might switch over to Preact

Using Scaffold from Kwoka in Discord.

`npm init @ekwoka/pett-app`

Use [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) in VSCode to preview the site after

`npm run watch`

Or not, this doesn't really have much? Its for a fast build script. Might want more boilerplate website to start with.
